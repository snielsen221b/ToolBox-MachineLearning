1. General trend of the curve?
Although the accuracy oscillates, the curve gets more accurate as more of the
data are used to train it.

2. Parts of the curve noisier?
Around 20-40% the curve is noisiest, likely because there is less data to train
with so it is more likely that the model will overestimate or underestimate and
usually by more.

3. How many trials does it take to get a smooth curve?
the curve gets smoother around 100 trial but doesn't get much smoother with
increased trials after that

4. What happens when you change the C value?
The accuracy increases faster when the C value is smaller
